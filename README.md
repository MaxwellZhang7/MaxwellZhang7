## 🧠 About Me

I’m passionate about information extraction, large language models (LLMs), and their applications in legal NLP.  
My research focuses on building **explainable, robust AI systems** for legal decision-making — such as legal QA, NER, and relation extraction — to enhance fairness and efficiency in the judicial system.

I have authored papers in **AI Open (IF 14.8)** and **Applied Intelligence (IF 3.8)**, and aim to contribute open, transparent tools for interpretable AI.
