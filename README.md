## 🧠 About Me

I'm passionate about information extraction, large language models (LLMs), and their applications in legal NLP. My research focuses on building explainable, robust AI systems for legal decision-making — such as legal QA, named entity recognition, and relation extraction — to enhance fairness and efficiency in the judicial system.  

I have authored papers in **AI Open (IF 14.8)** and **Applied Intelligence (IF 3.9)**, and aim to contribute open, transparent tools for interpretable AI.
